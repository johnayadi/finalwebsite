# P13186404 â€“ CTEC3905

## My public repository for CTEC3905 practical work

My repository will contain all the relevant files and documentation for the project. A website built using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript all for scratch.

Concept As an undergraduate the idea of a CV based website, I found that this was a great way to get this project done, but furthermore promote myself for the real world. By focusing on these two forms, this allows me to showcase my skills using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, for not only my project teacher, but my future employer. The subject of creative portfolios also allows for a wide scope of potential creative designs and the flexibility to be formally creative.

Language considerations When planning this project, a lot of different things came to mind in terms of consideration. The general idea for the project is to be as appealing as possible whilst presenting the content in an easy to read and navigate manner, good use of HTML and CSS will be essential. JavaScript can be used to perform more complex animations and transitions which CSS. I considered using so PHP and SQL but making a portfolio based online, PHP and SQL are not as prioritized.

### Header & Navigation Design
I made the header and navigation one unit, so the navitation is within the header. I made a logo within photoshop which has my intials 'JA' and the logo is also a link to the home page.

These pages are fully responsive and the image below shows what the page will look like on a mobile.

### Using a SVG
For the SVG i had to use illustrator to edit an image making sure it deosnt lose its pixelation, then i had to ID the differennt parts of the image so i could used diffent CSS technique to give the SVG image the effect of a moving still image.

### Content considerations

Due to the fact making a portfolio on yourself, gives me the adaptable to take control of what and how I want the content on my website to be presented. The large mass of content on the website will be made up of entirely original work, so copyright is of a minimal concern. I made a personal logo and wallpaper on Photoshop for the website. The logo is on the top-left part of the website, used for not only presentation but also as a link to the home/index page. The wallpaper is used as a background image for all my website pages, this was a case of keep all the external documents in the same folder so the website runs smoothly.
