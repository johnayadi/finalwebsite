<h1>WELCOME TO THE CV OF JOHN AYADI</h1>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<section>

<p>

Being 6’4 I’ve always been encouraged to do sports. Which has ultimately made me continue playing football and basketball.
I don’t play these sports at a professional level, but my friend and I meet up every week for a session at the park.
I’m also very much into music, which has taken me into a lane of the creation of beats. Making beats is a new hobby of mine, which is done on garage band and logic.
