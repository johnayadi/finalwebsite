                <div class="d2"> <h5>Showcase Cinema De Lux</h5>
                    This is the most important thing to remember when working customer service. Over the years, I’ve had customers yell at me for things that happened when I wasn’t there—prices, company rules and business hours. Even though I know there’s nothing I can do about any of those things, I’ll take what customers say very personally and start feeling guilty. It’s ridiculous, and I constantly have to remind myself that things are not my fault. I said everything I was supposed to say and did everything I was trained to do.</div>
                <div class="d3"> <h5>B&Q</h5>
                        knowledge. I was put through extensive training for horticulture where I learned how to pot and bed plants as well as diagnose diseases. 
                        My managers were always looking for ways to assist me in advancing in my B&Q career with more training where necessary. Often times I would be expected to carry out on-hand stock checks, pull orders for deliveries, assist customers in their purchases as well as give instructional classes on potting plants and after-care.
                        I participated in aisle resets and seasonal display building, often doing large set ups involving construction of platforms and building of displays such as barbecues.
                        Was also responsible for the care of all live plants we sold, ensuring they were watered as necessary and replenished continually from extra plant trolleys in the warehouse.
                        My colleagues were helpful in sharing their expertise in horticulture when I was unsure of how to help a customer. The overall atmosphere between co-workers of other areas were sometimes inconsistent. Mostly, if I asked for help in areas I had little knowledge I would be assisted but other times I might be told to find someone else.
                        The thing I enjoyed most about my job at B&Q was the experience of helping people accomplish projects they thought they couldn't do. I would often have repeat customers who would ask for only me and show me pictures of their gardens. Felt nice to make people happy.
